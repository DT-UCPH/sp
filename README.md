# The Samaritan Pentateuch

In this repo you find our Text-Fabric dataset of the Samaritan Pentateuch.
The dataset is work in progress, and so far, we have added a number of word features, which you find in the tf folder. The features are similar to those of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Amstelodamensis (BHSA), so we refer to the [BHSA feature documentation](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/) for more explanation of the features.
